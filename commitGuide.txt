Commit Message Conventions

Subject Line:
- Keep it concise (around 50 characters).
- Use imperative mood: "feat: Add new feature" not "Added new feature".
- Capitalize the first letter.
- Do not end the subject line with a period.

Body:
- Optional; explain the "what" and "why" of the changes in more detail.
- Wrap lines at around 72 characters.
- Provide context and reasoning behind the changes.

Prefixes:
- feat: A new feature for the user, not a new feature for a build script.
- fix: A bug fix for the user, not a fix to a build script.
- docs: Documentation changes.
- style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc).
- refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
- test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests.
- chore: Changes to the build process, auxiliary tools, or libraries.

Example:

feat: Implement user authentication

- Created login and registration functionality.
- Used bcrypt for password hashing.
- Implemented token-based authentication for API calls.
- Closes: #123 (optional)

Remember:
- Use clear and descriptive language.
- Separate subject from body with a blank line.
- Reference issues, if applicable, in the footer.
